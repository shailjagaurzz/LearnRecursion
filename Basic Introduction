Recursion is defined as a process which calls itself directly or indirectly and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.

Properties of Recursion:

Recursion has some important properties. Some of which are mentioned below:

The primary property of recursion is the ability to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems, each of which can be solved in the same way.
A recursive function must have a base case or stopping criteria to avoid infinite recursion.
Recursion involves calling the same function within itself, which leads to a call stack.
Recursive functions may be less efficient than iterative solutions in terms of memory and performance.
